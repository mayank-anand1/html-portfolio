<h2>My top 3 music albums of this year (2023)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3. could the grass be greener by remy</h3>
<p>It has a very pop and catchy vibe to it. It can definitely get me dancing or humming to the lyrics of the song. definitelya very slept on artist.Story straight, closer to thirty and checked out (featuring Public Library Commute) were my top songs off this one. Please do check him out.</p>
<h3>2. Let's Start Here by Lil Yatchy</h3>
<p>Lil boat in his pink floyd era and oh boy do i love it. its a spectactular album. It is very expeimental considering what he did with the viral poland song which was released prior to the album release. Paint THE sky, drive ME crazy! and pRETTy were my favs on this album. Very expeimental and i would definitely recommend everyone checking it out.</p>
<h3>1. Utopia by Travis Scott</h3>
<p>Unbelievable album by my favourite artist. definitely has some rodeo vibes to it. A couple of songs do seem to be inspired by kanye west's 2013 album yeezus but yeah its very great. Surely it was worth the 5 year wait by Mr. Travis. My Eyes, FE!N (featuring Playboi Carti) and Telekinesis (featuring Future and SZA) were the top songs on the album. Pleas eod check it out if you havent. Absolute masterpiece.</p>
